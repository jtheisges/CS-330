///How do I approach designing software?///
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  
I've gained experience in developing computer graphics by breaking down real-life images into primitive shapes, i.e., figuring out what primitive shapes make up a tree.  I attepmted to follow a modular process, by abstracting VBO and VAO setup to functions in the source.cpp file, as well as increased complex functionality, i.e., camera movement and cylinder creation.

///How do I approach developing programs?///
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  
As I mentioned above, a strategy I incorporated was mdular coding.  I made camera and cylinder functions reusable that way they could be called when needed.  When developing my first object, I didn't fully understand how to move objects in my world. Once I was able to understand that aspect, I was able to rely less on vertex points to direct the objects.  Thi sled to a cleaner and more readable friendly code.

  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

First, it gave me knowledge regarding c++.  Prior to this course, I had zero experience with this language and was a bit intimidated when I found out this was the language I had to use.  Learning a bit more about c++ definitely helps me professionally and educationally, since my degree is concentrated in software engineering.  I would not say this course helps me professionally too much, becuase I do not plan to pursue a professional path related to graphics.
